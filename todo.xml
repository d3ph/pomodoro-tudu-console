&gt; One more thing - would it be hard for tudu to do something like git?
&gt; That is, if there is a .tudu xml file in the current dir or one of the
&gt; parent dirs, load it by default? This way, I could keep my todo for my
&gt; app with the code, on my repository. It's not a big deal, as tudu -f
&gt; tudu.xml is not that complicated, but I think it could be nice.

Maybe with an env variable like TUDU_XML, if is not set tudu read your
$HOME/.tudu.xml if is set tudu reads the file on it. So you can set in
your .profile:
export TUDU_XML=.tudu.xml

But in this case I'm not sure what to do if the $TUDU_XML file don't exist.
Should I create it? I think the answer is yes, but in your case could not be
what you wanted.

I'll think about it. Could be a nice feature.

		<title>time accounting</title>
		<text>How about a feature to log when I had spent time on it in the past, which is sporadic for my long long list of todo's.  Such log can be amusing when looking back a few years down the road -- why did I spent that amount of time doing that !?
 
Taskwarrior has some thoughts on it

		<title>show category on the tudurc</title>
		<text>I use the commmand :showonly cat1 cat2 to see only this two categories. This works very fine. Is it possible to add this in .tudurc?

Because i use the same .tudu.xml for home and office. And i want only to see office categories on my laptop and only home categories on the privat pc.
